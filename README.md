# UIUC-Classroom-Finder
I am a a transfer student at UIUC meaning I took two of my four college years at another college, and I have only two years at UIUC. UIUC has a big flexing campus, but due to COVID, I was unable to experience the campus for my first four semesters here (2 summers, 1 fall, and 1 spring). Now that I have only a year to experience the campus, I am down bad to see as much as I can, so I wanted to get as many in person classes to have an excuse to be on campus. 

In addition, UIUC just opened up the new Campus Instructional Facility building that I was really hoping I could get a class in since it looked so cool. To my knowledge, UIUC's course explorer does not allow you to sort classes by classroom / buildings, so I took matters into my own hands and made this very crappy program.

I made this with very minimal knowledge of Python and no knowledge of Beautiful Soup, so the coding is very poor, but it served its purpose for me. 

Please if you have any knowledge in programming, do not look at this code. You will roast me, and your eyes will cry at my inefficiency.
